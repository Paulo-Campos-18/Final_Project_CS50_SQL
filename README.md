# Final Project - CS50 SQL (Harvard)

This project was developed as part of the **CS50 SQL course from Harvard University**.  
My database supports an **online store for buying and reselling digital game keys**, managing users, inventory, and payments while enabling **efficient data queries for business insights**.

Iâ€™m really happy to have completed the course with a project I dedicated so much effort to and truly enjoyed building.
